# NOTE: The direct routines used to create the database are not guaranteed to
# give identical results each time, particularly because stations for some
# cities are downloaded from API servers which may give variable numbers of
# stations, and even lead to variable numbers of trips. This function therefore
# tests the entire "live" API interface, while the remainder test the
# pre-generated database stored in /inst/db, which always generates reliable
# results.
#
# All files have 200 trips, but LA stations are read from trips, and has 2 trips
# that end at station#3000 which has no lat-lon, so there are only 198 trips and
# 50 stations, rather than 200 and 51.
#
# DC stations are read from internal data; CH from unzipped station data file
# containing 581 stations; and LO from server delivering all 777 stations
#
# Final expected values (from "bike_summary_stats ()"):
# city  |   ntrips  |   nstations
# ------|-----------|-------------
#  BO   |   200     |   93
#  CH   |   200     |   581
#  DC   |   200     |   456
#  LA   |   198     |   50
#  LO   |   200     |   776
#  NY   |   200     |   233
# ------|-----------|-------------
# Total |   1198    |   2189
# London in particlar expands rapidly and so tests are all for values >= these.
# To ensure this is failsafe, tests for numbers of stations are simply
# >= 93 + 581 + 456 + 5 + 233 + 700 = 2113
